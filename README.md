# [Project 1:  Web scraping For Jobs](https://github.com/Sawmonabo/WebScraper/blob/main/webScraper.py)
*  Perform web scraping with Python using the Beautiful Soup library.
*  Looking for python related job listing on Times Jobs website
*  Includes filter to exclude a specific skill.


# [Project 2: House Price Prediction](https://github.com/Sawmonabo/HousePricePrediction)
* Purpose of this project is to research and apply the various machine learning regression algorithms to undertake different models.
* Identify a hedonic property price model that can be used to predict residential property prices in Orlando as a function of the physical and locational attributes of the properties. 
* The data is first preprocessed and is then analyzed to summarize the main characteristics of the variables such as their correlation or any observable patterns.
* Engineered features from given data vairables (Including reverse enginnering x_coord and y_coord to actual measures of use, using geopy.geocoder and stateplane modules)
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Extreme Gradient Boosting using RandomSearchCV to reach the best model.
* The best model will be identified by the measure of MSE (mean squared error) and its accuracy to the validation set.
